</header>
<p class="noindent">The concept of “nonrepresentational” visualizations is unfamiliar and even seems counterintuitive. How can an image <i>not represent</i> something? But the emphasis in a nonrepresentational approach is on <i>making</i> rather than <i>showing</i>. In other words, a nonrepresentational image is the first step in an analytic or interpretative process, not a display of the results of an analysis or interpretation. The point of this appendix is to make clear how this approach works—and looks.</p>
<p>For interpretative methods to achieve their full potential, they need to enter into data structures through the graphic space of production. Any image that can be drawn can be translated into a data structure. For images, this can be done in a variety of ways. An image can be stored as pixels (like a tapestry, with instructions for each point), as a vector (shape that can be manipulated), as a set of instructions for rendering (surfaces, light, textures), and so on. By contrast, information visualizations are usually expressions of preexisting data. They are designed to express quantities, relations among them, and to use display algorithms to show features of data like proximity relations, centrality, and other relative values. Adding features like nonstandard metrics into these processes is a matter of modifying the data structure, not just the display algorithm.</p>
<p>For example: Think of the difference between storing data that describes a rectangular bar (coordinates on a grid with standard <i>x</i>-<i>y</i> axes, and weight/color of line) versus a bar with one side deteriorating. The edge that is deteriorating <i>can</i> be described in terms of rate of breakdown of the line, area over which this takes place, and other factors. That is a data structure, not just a picture file. Likewise, a metric on which such a square appears can be altered—suppose the <i>x</i> axis is meant to show time passing and the deteriorating square is about a breakdown in diplomatic relations. The tick marks on the <i>x</i> axis might very well alter to indicate time pressure building, stretched moments of news cycles, compressed moments of tension, <span aria-label="140" id="pg_140" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and stress indicators around decision points. All of these factors could be extracted through either computational analytics or traditional interpretative methods, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-1" id="fig_1">Figure 1</a> shows a standard metric charting a quantity on the <i>y</i> axis and a timeline on the <i>x</i> axis in the first panel (number of communications exchanged between two embassies in one day) and the effect of the changed information (or interpretation of information) in the next. The boundaries of the bar break because the timeframe is unclear and overlapping and communications are being exchanged so fast that it was not always evident even on which day they were received. The sequence of crossed communications cannot be sorted out. The effect is a time warp in which the day stretches, loses its boundaries, and the communications load is not fully calculable.</p>

</figure>
<p>The difference between <i>making</i> and <i>showing</i> is embedded in the order in which the work is done. When I make a sketch of the events just described, I create a primary visualization rooted in <i>interpretation</i>. If I rely entirely on computational analytics and then make a visualization, I am showing the <i>results</i>, and I have not used the graphics as my primary argument space. If I then modify the visualization—adding features, changing the structure or relationships of entities on the screen, and so on—then I am <i>making</i> again. This iterative and interpretative process is not yet an aspect of visualization platforms linked to data structures.</p>
<p><span aria-label="141" id="pg_141" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This appendix provides visual documentation of projects through which I have explored the idea of modeling interpretation since my initial formulation of temporal modeling in 2000.<sup><a href="appendix.xhtml#bm1-1" id="bm1_1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> All of the projects share certain principles, such as the idea of affective metrics (metrics that are nonstandard) and direct construction of argument through visual means. These principles will be illustrated first, and then the six approaches outlined in chapter 5 will be described. These approaches contain features from various research projects, and so sometimes an image will be taken from Temporal Modeling, Ivanhoe, I.nterpret, or 3DH, the four different rubrics under which most of the work was undertaken. The visual materials here consist of sketches, drawings, some screen shots of prototypes, and other ways of envisioning the basic functionality and conceptual operations of modeling interpretation. The lack of a functioning platform may diminish the credibility of this work for some readers. But recent work in visualization shows an increased interest in creating interpretative, rather than empirical, approaches, and this research is meant to assist in that development.</p>
<p>The first group of images demonstrates principles that appear across the projects: graphic argument, generative (or affective) metrics, inflection, point-of-view systems, and direct input (the two-way screen). While data modification is part of the behavior supported by the projects, data display is still part of the basic functionality.</p>

<p>The second group of images shows ways to implement these principles in each of several major areas of visualization—temporal and spatial modeling, network diagrams, knowledge organization, document-based research and argument (aided by analytics), and interface. While not every type of visualization is shown here (tree maps, whisker diagrams, bubble charts, cluster diagrams, and so on are not addressed), the principles of affective metrics and graphic inflection could be used in any of these formats.</p>

<p class="bhaft"><samp class="SANS_ITC_Stone_Sans_Std_Semibold_B_11">Graphic argument</samp></p>
<p class="noindent">The principle of <i>graphic argument</i> is fundamental to all nonrepresentational visualization. Graphic argument is the basic concept of using visual means to create an argument structure. The graphical features of proximity, sequence, ordering, placement, orientation, scale, and arrangement can all carry semantic values. In an analog environment, laying out slides on a light table, or organizing papers on a desk, or any other spatialized approach to working with research materials performs this work. The advantage of the digital environment is that this intuitively meaningful organization can be translated into a data structure that is stored as a relational schema or model independent of the contents of each object. Layers could be used to separate different parts of the argument, as in <a href="#fig-2" id="fig_2">figure 2</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>All of the graphic arguments depend upon the use of visual elements in semantically meaningful, legible, and intuitive ways. The line between conventional uses of visual elements and intuitive ones can be unclear, but basic guidelines for use of graphic variables can be found in most interface and user design textbooks.</p>
<p>The image on the left in <a href="#fig-4" id="fig_4">figure 4</a> shows basic graphic variables, borrowed from Jacques Bertin but augmented with animation elements and a few other features (like projection). Each can be assigned a unique role in a map, chart, interface, or design. Shapes, for instance, are easier to associate with different types of information while tonal values suggest relative degrees of intensity, and so on. The image on the right shows actions that can be taken to inflect or modify the presentation/creation of materials (documents or evidence, or components of a visualization).</p>

<h3 class="head b-head"><samp class="SANS_ITC_Stone_Sans_Std_Semibold_B_11">Affective metrics</samp></h3>
<p class="noindent"><i>Affective</i> or <i>generative</i> metrics are graphic expressions of nonstandard measure. These take into account, for instance, the effect of anxiety on the perception of time or space, or the impact of a particularly important piece of data on the structure of a graph or chart. In <a href="#fig-5" id="fig_5">figure 5</a>, the degree of anxiety has been tracked on the <i>y</i> axis against standard time intervals on the <i>x</i> axis. Then the length of lines, reflecting the rate of change, has been used to generate an <i>x</i> axis that incorporates these metrics. Any other phenomenon, such as expenditure of energy or analysis of sentiment, could be charted using the distortions introduced into the nonstandard metric, because these values are present in the experiential or user-dependent conditions being visualized.</p>

<p class="noindent">The concept of inflection is simply that of adding a graphic modification that nuances an otherwise blunt or reductive visual form. The capacity of human vision to register distinctions far exceeds the graphic vocabulary for charts and graphs currently in use. Inflection adds many subtleties and dimensions to the graphics. In <a href="#fig-6" id="fig_6">figure 6</a>, the difference between the images on the left and those on the right is dramatic. Graphical features like brightness, dullness, size, distance, and tonal definition carry semantic value by conventions that are easily legible.</p>

<p>In another example of inflection (<a href="#fig-7" id="fig_7">figure 7</a>), we can imagine that a standard representation of a quantity of data such as “how many residents approve of the proposed development” as a single bar on a chart does not do justice to the complexity of the <span aria-label="149" id="pg_149" role="doc-pagebreak"/>data set. A more nuanced presentation might show the specific makeup of that single bar in terms of other features in the data.</p>

<h3 class="head b-head"><samp class="SANS_ITC_Stone_Sans_Std_Semibold_B_11">Point-of-view systems</samp></h3>
<p class="noindent">Point of view inserts a subject position or user into the creation of an image. All images are created from some point of view, even if it is not marked. Perspectival images indicate the viewer/subject position through the creation of vanishing points that inscribe the position of a viewer within the structure of the image (as the place from which the image is drawn). If we take a standard scatter plot, the viewer is positioned as an omniscient, neutral subject seeing all points from the same position. But if we situate the viewer within the image, the relative values of the elements align in accord with a point-of-view system and vanishing points (<a href="#fig-8" id="fig_8">figure 8</a>). Imagine this as a chart of data displaying out-of-pocket medical insurance expenses (<i>y</i> axis) across time (<i>x</i> axis), first in an observer-neutral mode (left), then with respect to changing circumstances (now the <i>z</i> axis introduces a vanishing point). Then note the third rendering, in which a person in difficult <span aria-label="151" id="pg_151" role="doc-pagebreak"/>economic circumstances views the same data. The distortions indicate an affective relation to the information.</p>

<h2 class="head a-head"><samp class="SANS_ITC_Stone_Sans_Std_Semibold_B_11">Projects</samp></h2>
<p class="noindent">Having addressed a few basic principles of interpretative modeling, we can now review their application within projects.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h3 class="head b-head"><samp class="SANS_ITC_Stone_Sans_Std_Semibold_B_11">A. Temporal modeling</samp></h3>
<p class="noindent">The temporal modeling project was created to address the conviction that timelines designed for the empirical and social sciences are not suited to work in the humanities. Empirical timelines are continuous, unidirectional, <span aria-label="153" id="pg_153" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and homogeneous in their metrics. In humanities documents, such as works of literature or film, the subjective experience of time <i>as well as</i> the presentation of temporal information is often discontinuous (gaps or jumps between one chapter or scene and another), multidirectional (flashbacks, reevaluation of past events in light of new evidence, and so on), and nonstandard (some minutes are longer than others). These principles apply to the <i>telling</i> (plane of <i>discourse</i> in linguistic terms or <i>syuzhet</i> in narratology) and the <i>told</i> (plane of <i>reference</i> and <i>fabula</i>). While <i>time</i> may be conceived of as a given, a container into which events or occurrences can be placed, <i>temporality</i> suggests a relational and experiential framework.</p>
<p>The primitives, or basic components, of the temporal modeling system were points, events, and intervals (<a href="#fig-10" id="fig_10">figure 10</a>)—a set of inflections divided into <i>semantic</i> and <i>syntactic. Semantic</i> inflections consisted of attributes attached to any single component. An event might be characterized as <span aria-label="154" id="pg_154" role="doc-pagebreak"/>important or disturbing, or as relevant to one character and not another, and so on. But the attribute belonged to that single component. A <i>syntactic</i> inflection involved two or more components. These might be linked in a causal way, or in a reaction, or in any other codependent relation. Syntactic inflections could include anticipation, regret, and other effects of events on each other. The system contained a layering system to allow comparison among different models or parts of models. Finally, it included a now-slider, a slider that advanced the model along a separate timeline with tick marks outside of but correlated to the model. (This is the icon on the left in the lower gray menu bar that looks like an eye on a figure.) Missing from the implementation were a few crucial features, such as stretchy timelines and an elastic grid or base that could respond to affective values.</p>

<p class="noindent">Heterochronologies put multiple chronological systems into comparison with each other. One vivid example is that of a biblical chronological framework and one based on geological time. They will have certain points of connection and will share certain dates and time periods, but not all. This is one example of comparative ontologies, when ontologies are understood as classification systems.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-11" id="fig_11">Figure 11</a> shows biblical, classical Greek, and geological timescales in relation to each other (at left), and includes a concept of vague versus precise temporal references (at right). <a href="#fig-12" id="fig_12">Figure 12</a> shows a simple framework for charting temporal relations in two different dimensions—degree of <span aria-label="156" id="pg_156" role="doc-pagebreak"/>vagueness/specificity and relation to past/present position.

<p class="noindent">The concept of spatial modeling arises from the same impulse as temporal modeling—the belief that standard metrics are inadequate for showing how we experience spatial environments or for showing how these are presented in narrative and aesthetic work (or even journalistic work). The idea of affective mapping is demonstrated very simply in <a href="#fig-13" id="fig_13">figure 13</a>. A path appears on a regular cartographic grid in the first panel. In the second, an event occurs in the space. In the third panel, the space has contracted around the event, become compressed as a focal point, and the areas beyond the focus spread outward. This could be inverted, with the area where the event occurs actually expanding to show increased attention and detail (fourth panel).</p>

<h3 class="head b-head"><samp class="SANS_ITC_Stone_Sans_Std_Semibold_B_11">Network inflection</samp></h3>
<p class="noindent">The concept of inflection has been discussed in relation to the temporal modeling project. It feels most important in the realm of network visualizations, where the assumptions built into the display suggest that all relations (edges) are the same and all nodes are separate from the edges and remain unaffected by changes in circumstances and conditions. As almost no relations among human beings, entities, or institutions are stable, this system would allow the changes to register, but also insists on a <i>nodedge</i> concept in which nodes and edges are codependent on, not independent of, each other. In <a href="#fig-16" id="fig_16">figure 16</a> the nodes and edges both change.</p>

<h3 class="head b-head"><samp class="SANS_ITC_Stone_Sans_Std_Semibold_B_11">Comparative ontologies</samp></h3>
<p class="noindent">Comparative ontologies allow for contrast among different schemes of knowledge organization. This approach has implications for cultural memory practices, and in particular for exposing various biases built into classification systems produced in, for instance, western, first-world museums, archives, and libraries. Not all ontologies are structured in the same way. Some are hierarchical, but some are flat, some are matrices, and some are faceted. The purpose of this project is to make comparison among these systems visible. A feathered fan might, for instance, appear in a classification <span aria-label="161" id="pg_161" role="doc-pagebreak"/>system of fashion items, of ritual ethnographic pieces, or as evidence of an extinct species. Showing the relation among these and the extent to which an object belongs to multiple knowledge systems adds dimensions of cultural comparison into our visualizations.</p>
<p>Ontologies are usually expressed in language, even though they also depend upon graphic format to show hierarchy and groupings (sets and subsets). In <a href="#fig-18" id="fig_18">figure 18</a> the object “feather fan” is shown in its place in multiple hierarchies. The identity of the fan, as an artifact, is complicated by these multiple schemes. Such schemes also inscribe worldviews and cosmologies, and the placement of objects within them is a nonneutral act whose specificity is made more clear by contrast.</p>

<h3 class="head b-head"><samp class="SANS_ITC_Stone_Sans_Std_Semibold_B_11">Argument creation and a rich research field</samp></h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the advantages of digital tools and computational analytics is the benefit of scale. Large corpora can be examined and searched, though caveats on any automated process are many, even as tools become more sophisticated about context-dependent meaning, inference, use of thesauri, <span aria-label="162" id="pg_162" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and entity recognition. But the relationships between humanities documents and analytic tools, as well as analog argument structures and data structure, have not been fully worked out. A good case study might be to think about how an area of land where a battle took place could be mapped using spatial modeling tools across a period of time in which certain crucial events take place (requiring stretched metrics) using various kinds of evidence (<a href="#fig-19" id="fig_19">figure 19</a>). The evidence might include letters, journal entries, weather reports, newspaper accounts, field notes, photographs, physical/archaeological information, and other materials. The research would likely want to organize and order these materials, but also have a way to inflect the map with values generated from these documents. At an analytic level, processing meteorological data from a period of several months so that it can be correlated to events might be done best with computational tools. Sentiment analysis, also computationally generated, could be used to show the affective connection to the landscape and thus the importance of some areas more than others. In short, this platform/project encourages a back-and-forth iterative relation between traditional close reading, organization of evidence, argument construction, and a computationally supported generation of data used to model spatial features.</p>

<p>The full design of this research field would combine features of temporal and spatial modeling, inflection, comparative ontologies, and direct <span aria-label="163" id="pg_163" role="doc-pagebreak"/>input. It would synthesize elements of many of these examples into a single dashboard.</p>

<h3 class="head b-head"><samp class="SANS_ITC_Stone_Sans_Std_Semibold_B_11">Enunciative interface</samp></h3>
<p class="noindent">The challenge of creating a tool, platform, or visual convention for showing the “speaker” of an interface—or of parts of it—requires linking metadata from the internet feed and a display mechanism. When a webpage appears, it fills the screen window. No cracks or areas of unused screen real estate appear. And yet multiple “voices” are present. In a news site, the editorial and journalistic voices appear, sometimes unmarked by authorship attribution. Elements like mastheads or navigation systems are usually unattributed, while articles might have authorship indications. Advertisements are “spoken” quite differently than editorial material. Modes of direct address or indirect discourse may be marked in language, but not in the graphics.</p>
<p>Ways this might be done to break the illusion of seamless neutrality include “reveal codes” that show who is paying for each part of the display. <span aria-label="164" id="pg_164" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In addition, a legend could show whether the graphic work is a direct or oblique mode of address (looking at you, looking obliquely, or with back turned), situating the viewer in relation to the message and giving some indication of the demographic of the target audience. There could even be some amount of sentiment analysis indicating whether the content is within a norm for the site and how this compares with other sites (news treatments, for instance, could be visualized automatically to show spikes in tone or rhetorical deviation from their own norms or distance from each other).</p>
<p>In addition, a point-of-view system could be indicated in any web environment so that the site is shown through various filters or frameworks: from a point of view suitable for a six-year-old, a speaker of another language, a visually impaired user, or an adult with political leanings in one extreme or another. A filter device would make evident that any site is a constructed rather than neutral statement and that it is articulated by someone for some purpose.</p>

<p>The idea of taking the plane of a visualization and folding it at a crucial point to make comparisons is completely novel, but suggestive as a way of seeing differences in the development and continuation of situations. See <a href="#fig-27" id="fig_27">figure 27</a>, left side.</p>

<p>The right side of <a href="#fig-27">figure 27</a> uses a split or cut to carve off the portion of a visualization in which the maximum contrast occurs. A broken/implied axis is often used to show this when scale is preserved but the distance on the axis is so large that it is impractical to show the entire quantity being presented.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-28" id="fig_28">Figure 28</a> is a “heat map” approach to comparison. Any text or artifact can be humanly processed through markup or other means, or it can be processed in analytics using various parameters and filters. The comparison is in the layered rectangle in the middle of the image.</p>

<p>The density of data sets, their variation and granularity, is often ignored in favor of a reductive representation of a single quantity in a single metric scale. The approach here tries to “see into” the data at a higher level of specificity and also to suggest the nonuniformity of metric values (<a href="#fig-29" id="fig_29">figure 29</a>).<span aria-label="171" id="pg_171" role="doc-pagebreak"/></p>
