Because the dataset I've chosen is highly skewed, it's hard to represent all the data points on one scale. Therefore in this round, I've added a sliding feature, allowing visitors to slide through the type horizontally, to get detailed information on each category. Furthermore, there's a large marker on the slider, whose color is the same as the category being hovered on â€“ to better help visitors distinguish categories in the condensed area.
